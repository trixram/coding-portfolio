                    <p>The article I read, titled “Let Designers Think: How Thinking and Designing Need to Be Practiced Outside AI” by Chris R. Becker, helped expand my understanding of design by showing how often designers are overlooked or viewed as easily replaceable by AI. Becker explains that many companies treat design thinking as simple production work, when the most important part of the process is allowing designers time to reflect, explore ideas, and think about how to implement them in meaningful ways. This reminded me that design is not just about creating something quickly. It is about the thinking and intention behind what we make.



                    <br><br>



                   The CSS video I watched similarly connects to this idea. The video explains that CSS should be understood as a declaration of intent rather than a strict list of commands. This viewpoint encourages designers to be flexible with their tools and to know that the web is built to adapt to different users, devices, and environments. Instead of feeling frustrated with how CSS behaves, I can learn to work with it and recognize why it was designed to function the way it does.

    

                    <br><br>





                Both the article and the video emphasize the importance of staying flexible and human-centered when designing. Learning these concepts helps me feel more confident in my own approach, especially when something does not work perfectly on the first try. It also connects to what I have learned in lecture, where I gather feedback, explore multiple opinions, and think through how I can improve my website and mobile designs. Overall, these insights help me grow as a designer and understand how thoughtful design thinking can lead to better user experiences.
